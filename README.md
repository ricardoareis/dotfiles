# Kings Dotfiles

# Context

When I started as a Linux user (1996) and became a Sysadmin in 2000, there
were no simple ways to take the config files versioned remotely, equally
we can do now. In the last of +20 years, mostly of my dotfiles were lost,
and reconfigured from scratch.

# Disclaimer

IT WAS NOT PRODUCED TO BE A DISTRIBUTION, use it if you would like to have
a inspiration, fork it in your private, or public repo.

Feel free, to send me suggestions, but not inquiry me if something does work
as you like. Doubts are welcome, I will answer if a have time.

# Objectives

The main objectives of thees repository, as to reduce the wasted time in
recovery, and also, avoiding a misleading config in a complex environment.
Usually, everyone that already has been immersed with an open-source world,
either with a developer or as a user, knows how hard it can be to manage
them - and with me, it would be no different.

# Kings Dotfiles

# Context

When I started as a Linux user (1996) and became a Sysadmin in 2000, there
were no simple ways to take the config files versioned remotely, equally
we can do now. In the last of +20 years, mostly of my dotfiles were lost,
and reconfigured from scratch.  

# Objectives

The main objectives of thees repository, as to reduce the wasted time in
recovery, and also, avoiding a misleading config in a complex environment.
Usually, everyone that already has been immersed with an open-source world,
either with a developer or as a user, knows how hard it can be to manage
them - and with me, it would be no different.
